Title: Plug into Portland | Free Geek

Digital access is essential to nearly every aspect of society. We call the growing gap in access to technology the digital divide. It encompasses the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and Internet access and those who do not. Lack of digital access has a direct impact on the ability of students to achieve their full academic potential. This lack of access creates what is known as the "homework gap". The homework gap is the difficulty students experience completing homework when they lack access to a device and/or internet at home, compared to those who have access. This gap is still very alive in Oregon. Currently, 75,000 Oregon students do not have a personal computer to complete their online assignments.
