Title: Volunteer | Free Geek

Do you want to volunteer at Free Geek? Although we do not have the same volunteer program as we had in the past, we still have many fantastic opportunities for you to get involved with our organization. Check out our current volunteer opportunities, and fill out the form below so we can contact you!

Ambassadors

Our Ambassador Program is a group of individuals who are dedicated to sharing Free Geek's vision of including everyone in our digital future by letting their community know about Free Geek's work: through social media, email, fundraising, and more.

Tech Drives

Creating a tech drive for Free Geek allows us to get technology from people who may not know about us. Host a tech drive in your neighborhood, at your work, at your school, or wherever else you think people will drop off their used tech!

Fundraise

Hosting a fundraiser helps provide Free Geek with the donations we need to continue the work that we do. You can make a Facebook fundraiser, host a Give Lively fundraiser, create an event, start a walk-a-thon, start a bake sale, along with many other fundraising options!

Internship

Our internship application is currently open.

Warehouse Volunteering

Volunteering in our warehouse helps provide hands-on experience with used tech, from receiving technology, to sorting technology parts, to learning about the benefits of e-waste recycling. Fill out this form to apply.

Education Volunteering

Education volunteering is for people who know a lot about a certain subject in tech, and are interested in providing others with that knowledge. Currently our education volunteering is closed.
