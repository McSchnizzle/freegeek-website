Title: Education | Free Geek

In Oregon, only 55% of suburban high schools teach Computer Science at all-- and often, it’s an elective. But when 82% of middle-skill positions (positions that require more than a HS diploma but less than a 4 year degree) require digital skills, more than basic technological training is a rapidly developing need. This is why at Free Geek, we created a no experience necessary educational experience.  Click the links below to check out our educational courses and tutorials.
