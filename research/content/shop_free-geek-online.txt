Free Geek +

Did you know by purchasing any items from Free Geek, you directly support our work in combatting the digital divide?

27% of Americans do not own a computer. And one out of ten families do not have internet at home. This lack of access is sharply stratified along lines of income, race, age and education. Low-income families, immigrants, seniors and children are digitally under-connected, many with mobile-only internet access, which often isn’t enough.

This is a social justice issue. Without technology access, full participation in nearly every aspect of American society — from economic success and educational achievement, to positive health outcomes and civic engagement — is compromised.

Free Geek is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that helps the community by utilizing our funding to provide for those in need of a device. Buy today and help us in including everyone in our digital future.
