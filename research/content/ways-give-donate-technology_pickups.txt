Title: Large Donation | Free Geek

Do you have a donation of over 20 devices and are interested in finding a good time to drop off your technology? Please email dropoffs@freegeek.org to schedule a time.

Need help transporting your donation?  While you’re welcome to bring items directly to our facility for donation, Free Geek provides a paid pickup service for donations over 20 devices throughout the Portland metro area. Our friendly staff will pick up your technology with minimal disruption to your day. By scheduling your electronics recycling pickup with Free Geek, you'll know that your technology is being recycled according to the highest ethical standards or reused in one of our valuable community programs. Please fill out the form below.

**If you have less than 20 devices to donate to Free Geek, please see our Small Donation page.
If you are looking to donate corporate technology, please see our Corporate Donation page.
