"We at A Family for Every Child unconditionally support Free Geek; they serve an irreplaceable role in our community. Finding forever families for children who deserve them requires an incredible amount of coordination and access to a wide array of databases and online services.

The current COVID-19 pandemic further illustrates our organization’s dependence on technology, as a large portion of our workforce (interns and volunteers) are being forced to work from home. Were it not for the generous past donations of Free Geek, which have included more than fifteen desktops and monitors as well as numerous routers and webcams, we would neither be able to function during this health crisis, nor serve our mission as a whole."
