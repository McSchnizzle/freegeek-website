Due to licensing restrictions, we are generally unable to reuse donated software; our security protocol requires us to route these disks through our intensive <a href=\"/ways-give-donate-technology/data-security\">data security process</a>, so these donations take valuable time away from activities that support our mission. In addition, because of their low reuse value, paper manuals are typically sorted into curbside bins.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" class=\"collapsible-section-child-4-0\"><b>You can help speed up the processing and recycling of your equipment by:</b></p><ul dir=\"ltr\" class=\"collapsible-section-child-4-0\"><li>Untangling all cords and cables and coiling them up with a rubber band or twist tie.</li>\n\t<li>Attaching power adapters to their associated equipment</li>\n</ul><p class=\"collapsible-section-child-4-0\"><b>Turn Off Activation Lock for Mobile Devices</b></p><p class=\"collapsible-section-child-4-0\">If you would like your device to be reused it is critical to turn off the activation lock. Even if your device is damaged, it may be worth repairing as long as it is not locked. If you have an Apple (iOS) device, please follow these <a href=\"https://www.freegeek.org/sites/default/files/2018-07/Apple%20Unlock%20Instructions.pdf\">instructions</a> to prepare it for reuse.</p></div></details>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details><summary id=\"collapsible-section-title-5-0\">What is our data destruction process?</summary><div class=\"details-wrapper\"><p class=\"collapsible-section-child-5-0\">On top of our commitment to sustainable reuse of technology, we are fully dedicated to maintaining the security of your data.
