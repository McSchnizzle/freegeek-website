Title: Free Computers | Free Geek

27% of Americans do not own a computer. And one out of ten families do not have internet at home. This lack of access is sharply stratified along lines of income, race, age and education. Low-income families, immigrants, seniors and children are digitally under-connected, many with mobile-only internet access, which often isn’t enough. Free Geek started in order to provide digital access to all, and so came about our Digital Inclusion Programs.
