Are your community members in need of a computer?

Often nonprofits provide a full range of services for community members, from housing to job opportunities. Unfortunately, access to available technology to be granted to their community members is not easy to find. Free Geek offers grants to connect the community members that qualifying nonprofits serve with free and low-cost technology, in order to bridge the digital divide.
