## Mission Statement

> "To sustainably reuse technology, enable digital access, and provide education to create a community that empowers people to realize their potential."

---

## Core Purpose

Free Geek addresses two interconnected societal problems:

1. **Environmental Crisis:** Only 27% of e-waste is recycled nationally. E-waste represents 2% of America's trash but 70% of toxic waste in landfills.

2. **Digital Divide:** 27% of Americans don't own a computer. 1 in 10 families lack home internet. This gap disproportionately affects low-income families, immigrants, seniors, and children.

**The Solution:** Free Geek created a "circular model" that redirects electronic waste into the hands of underserved communities, solving both problems simultaneously.
